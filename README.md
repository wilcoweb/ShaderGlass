## ShaderGlass

Overlay for running GPU shaders on top of Windows desktop.

### Features

* applies shader effects on top of desktop, in a floating window or full-screen
* built-in [RetroArch](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch) shader library (1200+ shaders!) covering:
  * CRT monitor simulation
  * image upscaling
  * TV, VHS and handheld simulation
  * softening, denoising, blur, sharpen and many more
* works with most emulators, retro platforms and pixel art editors including:
  * [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/), [FS-UAE](https://github.com/FrodeSolheim/fs-uae), [Altirra](http://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html),
  [ScummVM](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm), [AGS](https://github.com/adventuregamestudio/ags), [VICE](https://sf.net/projects/vice-emu), [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) etc.
* excellent companion for pixel art showing shaded and/or aspect-ratio corrected preview
* you can even use it on top of YouTube, Twitch or modern games
* allows capture from a USB source (webcam or capture card)
* saving and loading profiles
* import of external .slangp/.slang shaders
* high customizability with various options, operating modes and shader parameters
* can be captured by OBS (using Game Capture source)

### Screenshots

ShaderGlass running over multiple applications on Windows 11 desktop.

![screenshot](images/screen7.png)

#### Desktop Glass mode

In this mode a transparent floating window will apply a shader to anything behind it.
Requires Windows 10 2004 - on 1903/1909 you will see only a black window if you switch to this mode.

Wikipedia in Chrome processed by crt-geom shader which applies scanlines and CRT curvature.

#### Window Clone mode

When capture is fixed to a specific window it's easier to tune scaling to match the input
and image can also be recaptured (screenshot/OBS etc.)

##### FS-UAE

Amiga version of [The Secret of Monkey Island (1990)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/32360/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island_Special_Edition/)
running in FS-UAE with crt-interlaced-halation shader applied.

##### Altirra

[Ninja (1986)](https://www.mobygames.com/game/ninja_) for the Atari XL
running in Altirra with a TV-OUT simulation shader.

##### Adventure Game Studio

[The Crimson Diamond (2024)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098770/The_Crimson_Diamond/),
a modern AGS game using HSM MegaBezel STD shader.

##### DOSBox

[Police Quest (1987)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/494740/Police_Quest_Collection/)
with its massive half-EGA pixels, aspect-ratio corrected and post-processed using newpixie-crt shader.

### Instructions & Manual

See [Online Manual](https://mausimus.github.io/ShaderGlass/MANUAL.html) for option explanations and Frequently Asked Questions.

<br/>

### Code

Built using Visual Studio 2022 using ISO C++ 20, Windows SDK 10.0.26100, Windows Capture API and DirectX 11.

ShaderGlass includes a limited implementation of RetroArch shader back-end using DirectX 11.
[ShaderGen](ShaderGen) is a command-line tool for converting Slang shaders 
into .h files which can be precompiled in ShaderGlass. The conversion process relies on:
1. [glslang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang) for converting Slang/GLSL shaders to SPIR-V
2. [SPIR-V cross-compiler](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross) for converting those to HLSL (DX11 format)
3. [Direct3D Shader Compiler (fxc.exe)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/) for pre-compiling into bytecode
